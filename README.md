### 👨‍💻 Who I Am

```
type: Developer
focus: ".NET Ecosystem"
location: "Turkey"
languages: ["C#", "JavaScript", "SQL"]
coffeeIntakePerDay: "Classified"
```

🔹 I craft **modular** and **secure** web applications using Microsoft technologies.  
🔹 I care about **clean UI**, **solid data structure**, and **human logic** in code.  
🔹 I'm not here for the trends — I'm here to build **things that work** (and look good doing it).

### 🧠 What Drives Me

```text
- Writing code that doesn’t just run — it communicates.

- Knowing when to abstract, and when to keep it brutally simple.
